> People who don't know solitude never understand this. They are obsessed with the loneliness in their lives. They make unrealistic demands on those they love because they look to them to fill this loneliness. In the name of Love they smother those around them with their needs and expectations. They demand total absorption as part of a relationship, and they fear the freedom of those to whom they try to give their love.
